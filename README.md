# Pymaceuticals study

### Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications has recently began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

### I had access to the complete dataset from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

### I have generated all of the tables and figures needed to provide a technical report and top-level summary of the study results.



## Steps to be taken to complete analysis:

* Prepare the data.

* Generate summary statistics.

* Create bar charts and pie charts.

* Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

* Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

* Calculate correlation and regression.

* Submit a final analysis.
